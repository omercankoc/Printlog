# Table View

Table views in iOS display rows of vertically scrolling content in a single column. Each row in the table contains one piece of your appâ€™s content. For example, the Contacts app displays the name of each contact in a separate row, and the main page of the Settings app displays the available groups of settings. You can configure a table to display a single long list of rows, or you can group related rows into sections to make navigating the content easier.

Tables are common in apps with data that is highly structured or organized hierarchically. Apps that contain hierarchical data often use tables in conjunction with a navigation view controller, which facilitates navigation between different levels of the hierarchy. For example, the Settings app uses tables and a navigation controller to organize the system settings.
